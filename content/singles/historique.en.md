##### The Blanchette’s story: from dreamers to accomplished businessmen 

###### Two visionary students

It all begins in 1995 as Vincent and André-François Blanchette, two cousins born in Sept-Îles, move to Québec City to study law and business administration, respectively. Both having been raised in an entrepreneurial environment (their grandfather and fathers were all businessmen), the two roommates dream, even as young children, of becoming the author of their own success story.

Bursting with grand ambitions, they seize a business opportunity to buy a bankrupt convenience store in 1996, seeing a golden opportunity to succeed. The two cohorts are far from knowing they are embarking on a very tumultuous venture, marked by unending weeks of the hardest work.

###### The family as backup 

A year later, Simon, Vincent’s brother, comes to lend a hand in the family project. The threesome puts in very long hours and pursues constant efforts to get the business back on track, working day and night. In 2000, the arrival of David, Vincent and Simon’s younger brother, opens the road to new possibilities, leading to more business projects. And finally, in 2004, Kimpton, André-François’ brother, joins them to complete the family clan.

###### A close-knit team 

Still today, the Blanchettes' greatest wealth remains working and collaborating together every day. They sit around a large table, in their communal office, and discuss and debate ideas always striving to raise the group to new heights.

With time, each member has organically made certain projects and responsibilities their own. Like chain links, each Blanchette’s work is closely intertwined and indispensable to the others.
