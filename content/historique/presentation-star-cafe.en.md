A mythical spot for many Québec residents, the STAR CAFÉ opens in 2001 in the heart of Sainte-Foy. Open 24 hours, the café with restaurant counter offered a fast food-style menu: breakfasts, paninis, ice cream and desserts were only a few of the specialties.

Its proximity to various campuses and extended business hours made this place ideal for study sessions or creation. It is said that many people of the artistic community would meet there to delve into their art.

In 2012, the group decided to sell to concentrate their efforts on major projects.
