Planète Nutrition, a food supplement store offering a wide variety of complementary products, is launched in 2015 by the group and an associate, William Déry.

The banner distinguishes itself from the competition through its personalized service, top quality private label and athletic grocery: a department offering food products to enhance customers’ physical health goals.

Now with 7 locations and a transactional Web site, Planète Nutrition is already well on its way to becoming one of the main players in its field.
