A big projet is currently in progress with the creation of the Halte-Bouffe Bouvier! Already implemented in the restaurant business with numerous banners, Groupe Blanchette now launches itself in the creation of an establishment that will welcome several restaurants to propose a full and separate offer to consumers. 

The Halte-Bouffe Bouvier will be located at a key spot that will make rejoice not only workers wishing to take advantage of a diversified offer during lunch break, but also passers-by. There will be more than 170 parking spots available for the consumers. And that’s not all! Delivery service will be offered for those who order meals from different restaurants of the food court on the same bill. A drive-thru will also be available. 

Pizzas, breakfasts, burgers and more will be part of this new project! You know people working in the restaurant business who would be interested to rent one of our unleased spaces? Spread the word, spaces between 500 square feet to 5000 square feet are vacant and there’s an estimated 200 000 people that pass by everyday. This is a huge opportunity!

Stay tuned for updates on our Facebook page.
