In November 2019, Groupe Blanchette acquired the restaurant Sushi X! Located in Lebourgneuf and running for almost 14 years, it sets apart from its competitors with its food quality, its originality and its generous servings. 

As soon as it was acquired by Groupe Blanchette, Sushi X was given a new look with a whole new dining room concept, higher-performance equipment, more convenient hours of operation and new arrivals. Indeed, new maki & hosomaki tartare specialties are now part of the menu. It’s a unique experience that is now offered to sushi lovers from Quebec City and the client feedback is overly positive!

With the success and the popularity caused by these changes at the branch in Lebourgneuf, Groupe Blanchette’s objective is to open several more Sushi X in the region. It’s, without a doubt, the combination of the service in the dining room, the take-out counter, the delivery and the attractive promotion of wines at SAQ price and beers at grocery price that make Sushi X stand out. This set of criteria leads us to believe that Sushi X has the potentiel to expand at a phenomenal speed with the opening of new branches.
