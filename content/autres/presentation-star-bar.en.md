A variation of the STAR CAFÉ, the STAR BAR, opens in 2004, to offer a restaurant-bar experience.
Its strategic location in Sainte-Foy’s La Pyramide mall made this spot a must for business meals as for festives outings and… team projects! Many former students will remember the irresistible specials on pitchers and unforgettable theme nights. 

A few years later, the group added the STAR CLUB to the existing bar for an enhanced offer. A dance floor leading to many fun, upbeat evenings made it a favorite.

Desiring renewal, in 2015 the group transforms the STAR BAR into a forward-thinking concept: SHAKER Kitchen & Mixology.
