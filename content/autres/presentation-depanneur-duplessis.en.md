This is the project where the adventure begins in 1996. Inspired by big dreams, Vincent and André-François, then students and roommates, buy a bankrupt convenience store, believing this is a golden opportunity.

Investing all their savings and time, the two entrepreneurs work night and day to put things back on track. They operate the business, make deliveries while also renovating the location. With the gradual arrival of other family members as backup, their efforts start showing results.

In 2017, the group decides to sell the business to focus on its other banners.
