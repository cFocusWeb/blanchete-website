After acquiring Sushi L in Lebourgneuf in November 2019, Groupe Blanchette had already planned to open other branches. The dream came true in February 2021, with the opening of Sushi X Pyramide! Having already several banners in the Pyramide Ste-Foy, Groupe Blanchette saw the potential of this location to please the surroundings : with Université Laval, colleges and office buildings around, many will enjoy this new sushi restaurant unlike any other. 



It’s in the heart of an entirely new local that the Ste-Foy branch will welcome its clients. The spacious dining room, the majestic central bar and the beautiful terrace will contribute to offer the most pleasant experience. In addition, numerous promotions are ongoing to satisfy everyone, everyday : MONDAYS & TUESDAYS MAKIS at $1.25 per piece, WEDNESDAYS at 15% OFF online orders, WINES AT SAQ PRICES AND BEERS AT STORE PRICES (with the relevant card in hand) and much more!



Now two places to enjoy the best, most generous, and least expensive sushis: in Lebourgneuf (6655, boulevard Pierre-Bertrand) or in Ste-Foy (2360, Chemin Ste-Foy).
