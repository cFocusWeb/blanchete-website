An ambitious project for the group and two of its associates, Pierre-Antoine Morency et Jean-Félix Bureau, VAPOSHOP is first launched as a line of vaping liquid products. Distributed in many Québec convenience stores, the brand becomes a great success, bringing its founders to open their own locations. In 2014, the first VAPOSHOP is born in Ste-Foy, followed by one in Lévis and one in Charlesbourg in 2017.
