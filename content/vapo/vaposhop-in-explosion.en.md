Specialized in vaping products, VAPOSHOP just opened a new branch in Beauport. This 5th store, located at 2400 boulevard Louis-XIV, emerges thanks to the overwhelming success of the Lévis and Limoilou branches, who had previously opened at the end of 2018. Not to mention, those located in Charlesbourg and Sainte-Foy quickly became leaders in the vaping industry with an average of 1000 customers served weekly per shop!

VAPOSHOP intends of course to continue on its streak and wishes to offer the possibility to new licensees to join its team. This is the opportunity to be part of a chain offering the widest selection of vaping products with more than 500 products, including an exclusive collection! Moreover, with the case recently won in the Superior Court that may allow the shops to be freely displayed in the future, it’s now the best time to embark in the vaping business.

It is with great determination that VAPOSHOP plans to expand its activity elsewhere in Quebec City and into the following territories: Montreal, Trois-Rivières, Drummondville, Saguenay, Rimouski and Côte-Nord.
