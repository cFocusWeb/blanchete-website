The VAPOSHOP banner, specialized in vaping products, continues to expand across the province and plans to open new branches in the regions of Québec, Montréal, Trois-Rivières, Drummondville, Saguenay, Rimouski et de la Côte-Nord.

After developing expertise in the production of vaping products, VAPOSHOP opens its own eponymous stores. The concept has evolved quickly to ensure that VAPOSHOP becomes a leader wherever their business is operated. Detaining and producing its own range of liquids gives it an undeniable competitive advantage.
