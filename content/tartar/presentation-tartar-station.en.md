The very first fast service counter specializing in tartares and poke bowls opens in 2017 at La Pyramide mall in Ste-Foy. The group’s project with two associates, Pierre-Antoine Morency and Jean-Félix Bureau, garners immediate interest from fans of tasty, healthy cuisine. Its unique concept, enabling to live the experience on site, to-go and on delivery, along with its online order system and interactive ordering terminals adapts to a customer base that is more than ever enamored with new technologies.
Following the success of the first TARTAR Station, the team plans to open two other locations in the coming months.
