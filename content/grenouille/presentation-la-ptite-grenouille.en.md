With the Little Frog live show & party house bars, the group brings the live singing experience to a larger public, this type of concept once being reserved to smaller spaces with a more limited crowd. The Little Frog comes with a simple and proven concept: live music or stand-up acts,many specials on drinks and festive theme nights. From its very beginning in 2005, party fans who love "the good old days" meet there to sing old hits out loud. Now with 16 locations throughout the province, the Little Frog continues to expand always with the same success.
