With La P'tite Grenouille live show bars, the group brings the live singing experience to a larger public, this type of concept once being reserved to smaller spaces with a more limited crowd.

La P'tite Grenouille comes with a simple and proven concept: live music or stand-up acts, many specials on drinks and festive theme nights. From its very beginning in 2005, party fans who love "the good old days" meet there to sing old hits out loud.

Now with 17 locations throughout the province, La P'tite Grenouille continues to expand always with the same success.
