The Foodtastic franchisor, who owns several banners in the restaurant business, has recently acquired Chocolato. It’s with great pride that the group transfers the banner to watch it grow not only outside of the province, but also in the United States. 

In less than 4 years, Chocolato spread like wildfire and generated the opening of 22 branches across the province. The great variety of chocolate dippings and the unique products such as Sundae Royal and Pizza Dessert allowed the brand to stand out from its nearby rivals. It’s fair to say that the journey of Chocolato within the Groupe Blanchette enabled it to grow incredibly and to position itself as a leader in the field. 

The group, who remains owner of the Sainte-Foy (Versant Nord) branch and the express kiosk located in the Pyramide de Sainte-Foy and co-owner of the Gatineau (Les Promenades Gatineau) branch, is glad to see the growth potentiel for Chocolato!
