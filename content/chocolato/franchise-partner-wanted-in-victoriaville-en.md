Chocolato Chocolate & Ice Cream Bar continues to expand across the province and is opening a brand new store in Victoriaville. 

The future Chocolato will take up residence in a busy neighborhood, at the corner of boulevard des Bois-Francs South and Jutras East, in the former Burger King. The presence of a terrace as well as facilities allowing drive thru service make this location a prime location to the establishment of a Chocolato.

The unique concept of four-season dairy & chocolate bar will bring a fresh breeze to the commercial landscape of Victoriaville. The wide selection of products offered by the banner leaves its closest competitors far behind: 20 dipping choices, 20 candy varieties, 12 gelati and sorbets flavors, many homemade desserts, fondues to enjoy on the spot or to take out, fine chocolates, gift baskets and other chocolaty surprises.
