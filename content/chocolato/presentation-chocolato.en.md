A true passion project led by love of chocolate, Chocolato is founded in 2015 by the group and an associate, Guyaume Arsenault. With the desire to offer an experience that is at the crossroads between a dairy bar and a chocolate shop inspired by the most prestigious Italian chocolate shops, a first location opens in Sainte-Foy. 

The purest, best quality ingredients are the basis and inspiration for Chocolato’s products. In addition to 20 choices of chocolate dippings, Chocolato was truly a pioneering force in offering the dipped ice-cream experience year-round.

Only 8 months later, a second Chocolato opened at Galeries de la Capitale along with a third in Lévis in October. In 2017, the rise continues with consecutive openings in Gatineau, Québec (Laurier Québec, rue Saint-Jean, Chauveau, Charlesbourg), Joliette, Brossard and Shawinigan. To meet the growing demand, Chocolato also opened a new warehouse in Québec City. 

At the time this is being written, the Chocolato family now has 12 locations, with no signs of slowing down! The team behind Chocolato is determined to share their passion for chocolate nationally and internationally, making all fans of sweet delights happy.
