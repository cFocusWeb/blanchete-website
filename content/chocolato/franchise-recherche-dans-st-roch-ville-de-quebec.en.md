Chocolato Chocolate & Ice Cream Bar continues to expand across the province and is opening a brand new store in the neighborhood of St-Roch in Quebec City.

The future Chocolato will take up residence in a high traffic area, on the corner boulevard Charest and rue du Parvis. Located in a building with great character, the future Chocolato will enjoy a very high visibility, and its location will allow the possible combination with other fast food counters such as Frit’s Burgers & Poutines.

The unique concept of four-season dairy & chocolate bar will bring a fresh breeze to the commercial landscape of St-Roch. The wide selection of products offered by the banner leaves its closest competitors far behind: 20 dipping choices, 20 candy varieties, 12 gelati and sorbets flavors, many homemade desserts, fondues to enjoy on the spot or to take out, fine chocolates, gift baskets and other chocolaty surprises.
