After setting foot in several regions of Quebec, the big SHAKER family opens a first restaurant in Montérégie, specifically in St-Hyacinthe! It's in July 2018, in the middle of the summer season, that this 12th SHAKER Kitchen & Mixology welcomed its first customers.

Taking place in the former premises of La Cage - Brasserie Sportive, SHAKER St-Hyacinthe brings a breath of fresh air to the culinary offer on avenue Cusson and to the nightlife of St-Hyacinthe. Designed to accommodate small and large groups, it contains 225 seats, including forty around its convivial central bar, sixty on its sunny terrace and fifty in its beautiful private lounge.

A large table named "Le Bordel" is also created to welcome multiple groups simultaneously. It's perfect for improvised parties where no reservation is necessary and where the pleasure continues until the wee hours!

For a business lunch, a happy hour or a dinner stretching until the end of the evening, the SHAKER St-Hyacinthe awaits you with its many choices of tartares & tataki, not to mention its wide selection of mixology cocktails!
