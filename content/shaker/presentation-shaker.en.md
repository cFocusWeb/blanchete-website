In 2015, the group updates the STAR BAR and presents SHAKER Kitchen & Mixology: a restaurant-bar with a chic industrial décor. On-trend cuisine, creative cocktails and an undeniable festive atmosphere make these restaurant-bars the perfect venue for business meals, trendy dinners and nights on the town.

The banner instantly becomes a huge success, making immediate expansion a must. With 10 locations opening throughout the province in under 2 years, SHAKER Kitchen & Mixology has quickly found its niche as the only restaurant-bar chain specializing in tartares, cocktails and gourmet burgers.

SHAKER Kitchen & Mixology’s rise continues with many more openings planned for the coming year, in Québec and other provinces.
