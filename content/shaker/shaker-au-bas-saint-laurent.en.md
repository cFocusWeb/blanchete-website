The SHAKER Cuisine & Mixology chain continues its expansion with the opening of a fourth Bar & Grill in December 2016. Located in the heart of downtown on Saint-Germain Street, in the former Bar chez Pull location, Shaker Rimouski offers 195 seats along with the largest terrace in town for the summer season.

With an investment of close to 1 million dollars to develop and furnish the location, its arrival created many jobs and generated considerable new income for the area.

People of Rimouski, the SHAKER experience awaits you with its warm, welcoming ambiance and friendly staff! #Live Once
