Soon after the opening of the Cap-Rouge restaurant, this all new SHAKER open its doors in the heart of Lévis in May 2016! 

In the former Steak Shop location, SHAKER Lévis is planned just in time for the start of warmer weather!  
Offering 175 indoor seats and a 100-seat sun-filled terrace, SHAKER Lévis is undoubtedly the new destination to discover in the area, as much for business luncheons as for festive evenings. 

The same appealing, successful concept: a most enviable cocktail selection and a menu offering gourmet burgers and tartares. 

See you at SHAKER Lévis!
