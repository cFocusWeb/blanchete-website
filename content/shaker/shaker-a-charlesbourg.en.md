Charlesbourg residents, your wishes have been granted! The fifth SHAKER Cuisine and Mixology has chosen this locality north of Québec’s Downtown as its new location! Open for the first time last January, only hours after the final works had been completed! Located in the former Cage aux Sports, the Bar & Grill offers once again the chic yet laid back ambiance for which it has become known. Come discover the variety of 12 tartares and enjoy one of our signature cocktails. Our 240-seat location awaits, book your table now!

The SHAKER Cuisine & Mixology chain continues its expansion throughout the province of Québec. Now with 5 operating restaurants (Ste-Foy, Cap-Rouge, Lévis, Rimouski & Charlesbourg) and 2 new openings planned for springtime (Rivière-du-Loup & Gatineau), SHAKER has wind in its sails! And the adventure has only begun… Stay tuned for more!
