It's no longer a secret to "the locals": St-Georges is now home to the 8th SHAKER restaurant-bar!

Open since last July, the newest member of the SHAKER family has already conquered the heart of everyone. Even before the official announcement of its opening, the people of St-Georges were buzzing about their upcoming visit to this new restaurant!

In addition to the 185-seat indoor dining area, SHAKER also offers a vast covered terrace for your enjoyment. This cozy and intimate space with 100 seated places is the perfect urban oasis with its spectacular hanging garden wall integrating an ingenious blend of wood and concrete throughout its greenery and comfy outdoor furniture for total relaxation to enjoy a well-deserved drink. The best part of all this? Our terrace will welcome you from spring to fall under the pleasant cover of our roof, sheltered from the elements! An extended terrace season? Now we're talking!

New restaurant, but with the same proven formula you adore: Deliciously creative cocktails, 12 choices ot tartares, tatakis and burgers; all this and so much more, in the perfect setting for good times!

From lunch to late evenings, cocktail hour to dinner, SHAKER St-Georges is THE destination for fun!
