In the past weeks, the seventh restaurant in the SHAKER Kitchen & Mixology banner opened its doors in Gatineau, for the greatest delight of the area’s amateurs of tartares and cocktails.

Anxiously awaited, area residents showed the greatest welcome: only a few days after its opening, the restaurant’s success was so immense that new employees came in for backup!

Located at Les Promenades Gatineau, the restaurant-bar caters to its new clientele with 250 seated places, in addition to a beautiful front terrace for summertime.

The last born in the banner doesn’t remain that way for long! Indeed, the opening of an eighth location in Saint-Georges is in the works for the coming weeks; making Beauce’s amateurs of festive ambiances and good food the happiest!

Each restaurant has its own atmosphere and décor, but always the same proven recipe for success: an impressive choice of dishes and cocktails evolving with the seasons, a delightful combination for its loyal clientele!
See you at SHAKER!
