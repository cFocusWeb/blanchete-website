A little over 11 months since the first restaurant opened, a second SHAKER location is announced.  

Spurred by the success of their first location, the owners joined forces with three new partners to create SHAKER Franchisor. Together, they carry on their adventure by opening a new industrial chic restaurant-bar. In March 2016, tartare and cocktail enthusiasts will have the pleasure of living the Cap-Rouge SHAKER experience!
 
Just like its predecessor, this new restaurant also promises a welcoming ambiance where good food and mixology meet for a unique experience. Tartares and burgers are still at the center of the dining pleasure and a selection of more than 50 cocktails are offered to complete the experience! 

Located in the former Pub St-Philippe, SHAKER Cap-Rouge offers a 110-seat dining area along with a 60-seat summer-themed terrace. 

SHAKER Cap-Rouge: a place to discover on your next outing!
