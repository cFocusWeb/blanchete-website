The fast food banner Frit's Burgers & Poutines continues to expand across the province and is preparing to open a brand new branch in the neighborhood of St-Roch in Quebec City.

The future Frit's Burgers & Poutines will take up residence in a high traffic area, on the corner boulevard Charest and rue du Parvis. Located in a building with great character, the future Frit's Burgers & Poutines will enjoy a very high visibility, and its location will allow the possible combination with other fast food counters such as Chocolato.

The arrival of this unique concept will bring a fresh breeze to the commercial landscape of St-Roch. The originality of its menu leaves its closest competitors far behind: 10 choices of classic and deluxe burgers, 12 one of a kind poutines and other reinvented fast food classics. Its flexible hours and delivery service make the commercial offer of Frit's Burgers & Poutines very attractive to consumers.
