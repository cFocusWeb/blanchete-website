In 2011, the group and one of their associates, Guyaume Arsenault, embark on a whole new adventure with Frit's Burgers & Poutines. Fans of delicious food enjoy deluxe burgers, over-the-top poutines and other revisited fast food classics. Their first restaurant in Ste-Foyâ€™s La Pyramide mall then leads to a second restaurant in Beauport in 2017, others will follow in the coming years.
