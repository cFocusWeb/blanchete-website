The fast food banner Frit's Burgers & Poutines continues to expand across the province and is preparing to open a brand new branch in Victoriaville.

The future Frit's Burgers & Poutines will take up residence in a high traffic area, at 160, boulevard des Bois-Francs Sud, in the former Extreme Pita. The interesting business installations such as the terrace and the drive thru service make this a prime location to the establishment of a trade.

The arrival of this unique concept will bring a fresh breeze to the commercial landscape of Victoriaville. The originality of its menu leaves its closest competitors far behind: 10 choices of classic and deluxe burgers, 12 one of a kind poutines and other reinvented fast food classics. Its flexible hours and delivery service make the commercial offer of Frit's Burgers & Poutines very attractive to consumers.
