## VAPOSHOP – Overview of the banner

### First a line of products 

In 2014, the group and two young entrepreneurs establish VAPOSHOP and venture into the market of vaping liquid products. Their line of products soon becomes very popular and is distributed at 65 locations throughout Québec.  

### Opening locations

After developing an initial expertise in vaping products, the team behind VAPOSHOP decides to launch a chain of shops of the same name. They open a store in Ste-Foy in 2014, another one in Charlesbourg in 2017 and plan to open two new branches in Limoilou and Lévis in November 2018.

The concept has quickly evolved to allow VAPOSHOP to become a leader wherever their businesses are in activity. Owning and producing their own line of vaping liquid products gives them an undeniable competitive edge.
