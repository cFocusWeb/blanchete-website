## SHAKER Kitchen & Mixology – Overview of the Banner 

### A success story 

Since its beginning in April 2015, the SHAKER Kitchen & Mixology banner has become an enviable model for its unique concept welcoming a diverse clientele to enjoy a distinctive, creative culinary experience, in an upbeat atmosphere.

An impressive creative cocktail menu, a large selection of tartares and gourmet burgers along with many meal and cocktail promotions, are only a few of the reasons why these restaurant-bars have become so popular throughout the province.

### A business model for the future

Where others fail, a SHAKER restaurant is established, and thrives. In a universe where restauranteurs build locations with dimensions and layouts that are identical from city to city, SHAKER Kitchen & Mixology, on the opposite, adapts and remodels existing restaurants that closed down, thus saving greatly on set-up costs.
