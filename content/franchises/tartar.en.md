## TARTAR Station – Overview of the Banner 

### A success story

TARTAR Station was born in 2017, and is already an operational location, with a second one planned to open also this year. 

Starting out as an idea, the concept becomes a reality two years after the first image came into the mind of the two entrepreneurs: create the first chain of "fast food" style restaurants specialized in tartares and poke bowls, serving these dishes on location, but also, to-go and on delivery. In order to reach its objective, the twosome originating the concept joins forces with the Groupe Blanchette – Master Franchisor’s expertise, making their big dream a reality. A few months later, TARTAR Station rounds out its offer by adding an exclusive line of cold infused teas to their restaurant, LT teas.

### TARTAR 2.0

First starting with a different brand image and a strong presence on social media, the TARTAR Station brand enjoys an immediate clientele because it adapts to a customer base that is more than ever enamored with new technologies. Interactive ordering terminals on location and a comprehensive online ordering system make the experience user-friendly for all customers.

Always striving to satisfy its clientele, TARTAR Station also innovates with its product offer by adding an exclusive line of cold infused teas to its menu, LT teas, along with a selection of meals to-go.
