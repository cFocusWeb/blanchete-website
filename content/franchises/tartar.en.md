## TARTAR Station â€“ Overview of the Banner 

### A success story

Two years after the general outline of the TARTAR Station project, the first restaurant was born in February 2017. The two young entrepreneurs at the base of the concept join forces with the expertise of Groupe Blanchette - Master Franchisor to achieve their purpose, and create the first fast food chain specializing in tartares and poke bowls, serving its dishes on the spot, as well as for take-out and delivery.  


### TARTAR 2.0

First starting with a different brand image and a strong presence on social media, the TARTAR Station brand enjoys an immediate clientele because it adapts to a customer base that is more than ever enamored with new technologies. Interactive ordering terminals on location and a comprehensive online ordering system make the experience user-friendly for all customers.

Always striving to satisfy its clientele, TARTAR Station also innovates with its product offer by adding an exclusive line of cold infused teas to its menu, LT teas, along with a selection of meals to-go.
