## Chocolato – Overview of the Banner

### A success story 

LIttle over 2 years after the adventure began in August 2015, the chocolate & ice cream bar banner counts 12 locations throughout the province, and plans many openings over the coming months.

With storefront concepts, mall, location and "express" counters, Chocolato keeps on expanding throughout Québec spreading its love of chocolate. 

### So many choices 

Chocolato distinguishes itself from its closest competitors by its vast choice of products, starting with 20 permanent flavors of chocolate dips as well as a new monthly surprise flavor. 

However, the Chocolato experience is far from limited to "simple dipped cones"! Chocolate lovers can enjoy their choice of dipping in every way possible, on a frozen or homemade (crepe, waffle or cake) dessert or in a hot drink. All of these divine personalized creations can be garnished with 20 sweet or salty choices from the candy bar. 

Besides products enjoyed on site, customers can purchase derived products on location to share delicious chocolate moments with their loved ones: certified nut-free chocolate fondue cans, maple products, fine chocolates along with an array of gift baskets for all tastes and budgets.
